### Creating Covid dataset
This project was embarked to try to create a dataset capturing the weather conditions of the assumed day of infection for a person infected with Covid19. The logic behind this estimation might not be correct as it was done using the popular knowledge of symptoms showing after 7 days of being infected. Public data available on google was used for this project.
